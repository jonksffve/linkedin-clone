# LinkedIn clone – React project

This is a project just to show my skills using React, NOT intended to be an actual copy or replace of the platform.

Starting with Vite to host the development environment. npm create vite@latest
I'm using “firebase” as our backend handler. npm install firebase
I'm using react-router as our MPA routing logic handler. npm install react-router-dom
I'm using react-toastify as our message notification system. npm install --save react-toastify
I'm using antd in order to render already built components, to improve UI-UX. npm install antd
I'm using react-icons for our project. npm install react-icons –save
I'm using moment.js in order to improve date formatting. npm install moment –save (as a customHook)
I'm using react-redux toolkit to handle slice states. npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

#TODO
*.	Create NavLinks that update the “active” route
